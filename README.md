# Learning-Data-Analysis-with-R-Video-


This is the code repository for [Learning Data Analysis with R (Video)](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-data-analysis-r-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.


 


## About the Video Course

R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

This video delivers viewers the ability to conduct data analysis in practical contexts with R, using core language packages and tools. The end goal is to provide analysts and data scientists a comprehensive learning course on how to manipulate and analyse small and large sets of data with R. It will introduce how CRAN works and will demonstrate why viewers should use them.

You will start with the most basic importing techniques, to downloading compressed data from the web and learn of more advanced ways to handle even the most difficult datasets to import. Next, you will move on to create static plots, while the second will show how to plot spatial data on interactive web platforms such as Google Maps and Open Street maps. Finally, you will learn to implement your learning with real-world examples of data analysis.

This video will lay the foundations for deeper applications of data analysis, and pave the way for advanced data science.
